# Fake News Detection

This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect fake news articles. The dataset contains news articles labeled as real or fake. We use various natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify news articles.

## Project Structure

- `fake-news-detection.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code to train and evaluate the model.
- `AIML fake new detection project.pdf`: A PDF report summarizing the methodology, results, and conclusions of the project.
- `Fake.csv`: Dataset containing fake news articles.
- `True.csv`: Dataset containing real news articles.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kruthikabn/FakeNewsDetection.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    cd FakeNewsDetection
3.Install the required dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
   
#Usage
Open the fake-news-detection.ipynb notebook.
Run the code cells sequentially to:
Load the dataset.
Preprocess the data.
Train machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes).
Evaluate model performance.
If you'd like to use the model for your own predictions, ensure your data is in the appropriate format and run the model on it.
